%% Frequently asked questions
% Awnsers to frequently occuring questions and troubleshooting topics.
%% What software versions are supported?
% * For the Drone firmware version 2.4.8 has been tested. On the computer side 
% Windows 10 x64 is tested with MATLAB 2016a x64
%% What C compiler is needed with MATLAB?
% * This project has been tested with the MinGW64 compiler available through 
% the Add-On manager and with the Microsoft C++ 2015 Professional (C) compiler. 
% You can type 'mex -setup c' to see which compiler you have currently set up 
% to use in MATLAB.
%% Which ARM compilers are supported?
% * The only tested ARM compiler is the Code Sourcery CodeBench Lite for ARM 
% 2011.03-41. Currently Mentor no longer links to the used version on their website 
% but it can still be downloaded using the <https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package8738/public/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2011.03-41-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.exe 
% direct link> (as of May 2016). 
%% Do I need to modify the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 before using this package?
% * No Modifications are necessary, simply connect your PC to the WIFI network 
% set up by the AR Drone 2.0 and you will be able to build and run the Simulink 
% models on the AR Drone 2.0.
%% Will uploading any of the provided models to the Drone prohibit the factory flight options? (flying with the app?)
% * The process of uploading the custom Simulink model onto the drone kills 
% the default Program.elf running on the drone responsible for factory flight, 
% however when the Drone reboots it will execute it's default Program.elf again 
% putting the drone back in factory flight mode.
%% How can I acces the Drone filesystem?
% * Using your favorite Telnet protocol you can acces the Drone at it's default 
% IP of 192.168.1.1 (e.g. type 'telnet 192.168.1.1' into a Windows command prompt). 
% The drone uses a small version of BusyBox for shell commands limiting what is 
% available to you. Usefull commands are 'reboot' in case the AR Drone becomes 
% non responsive or checking out the various files on the drone with vi, such 
% as the firmware version located in /firmware/version.txt
%% How do I stop a program running on the AR Drone without using external mode?
% * Rebooting the AR Drone (either unplugging the battery typing reboot in a 
% telnet session with the AR Drone 2.0) will kill any custom program. To specifically 
% kill just a single program type 'top' in a telnet console to see all running 
% programs and their PID (Process ID). Typing 'kill 'xxxx'' will kill the process 
% with PID 'xxxx'
